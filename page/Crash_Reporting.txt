<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Crash_Handling"> Crash Handling </span></h1>
<p>If you're crashing, it could be for a number of reasons.
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Addons"> Addons </span></h1>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Did_you_just_install_an_addon.3F"> Did you just install an addon? </span></h2>
<p>If you just installed an <a href="/page/Addons" title="Addons">addon</a>, disable it and see if that stops the crashing. If so, then it's likely that either the addon is from Garry's Mod 12, or the developer made a mistake. You should ask the developer to fix it, rather than Garry.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Reporting_broken_addons.2Faddon-related_lua_errors"> Reporting broken addons/addon-related lua errors </span></h2>
<p>Send a message to the creator of the addon, along with the specific error (which can be found in the console) and what you were doing that caused the crash.
If you don't tell the creator enough information, they can't fix it. Don't complain if you didn't help them.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Engine_Updates"> Engine Updates </span></h1>
<p>It's possible another of your addons has broken due to an update to either Garry's Mod itself or to the TF2 engine. <b>Try disabling all of your addons</b> to see if that fixes the problem. If it does, you'll need to enable them one-by-one to see which one is causing the crash.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="My_Computer"> My Computer </span></h1>
<p>Please make sure you meet the minimum specs, shown below:
</p><p>PC:
</p>
<pre>   Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7
   1.7 GHz Processor
   512MB RAM
   DirectX 8.1-compatible graphics card with SSE
</pre>
<p>Mac:
</p>
<pre>   Leopard 10.5.8 / Snow Leopard 10.6.3
   1.7 GHz Processor (likely)
   1GB RAM
   nVidia GeForce 8 or higher / ATI X1600 or higher / Intel HD 3000 or higher
</pre>
<p>If you don't use equivalent or better hardware, don't expect to run Garry's Mod. DirectX 7 is <i>not</i> supported.

<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Reporting_bugs.2Fcrashes_relating_to_Garry.27s_Mod_itself"> Reporting bugs/crashes relating to Garry's Mod itself </span></h1>
<p>If you're crashing - then just telling us you're crashing isn't very helpful. You need to provide a crash log.
</p><p>Create a new issue on official <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/Facepunch/garrysmod-issues">Garry's Mod bug tracker</a>, <b>after reading the read me on the front page</b>, and if you are crashing attach some crash logs. You can find out where to find them below.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Windows"> Windows </span></h2>
<p>You can find crashlogs in your game folder. ( Usually Steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod/ ) They end with ".mdmp". These contain information we can use to work out why you have crashed.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="OSX"> OSX </span></h2>
<p>When you crash on OSX we will need to see your stack trace. You can get this when it crashes by clicking on "send report", then on "details". We need you to copy and paste everything from the white text box.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="More_Information"> More Information </span></h2>
<p>While a crash log on its own is useful, you can help us further by providing the following information:
</p>
<ul><li> What you were doing when the crash happened?
</li><li> Can you make it crash again? If so, how?
</li></ul>
<p>If it's a crash on startup, or when starting a new game:
</p>
<ul><li> Does it crash without any addons?
</li><li> Does it crash on all maps?
</li><li> Does it crash in singleplayer / multiplayer / both?
</li></ul>
