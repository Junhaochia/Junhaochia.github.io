</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Includes"> Includes </span></h2>
<p>As seen in the example files, your QCs <b>need</b> to include:
</p>
<ul><li> commonbones.qci (male or female)
</li><li> ragdoll.qci (male or female)
</li><li> hitbox.qci (always male)
</li><li> standardikchains.qci
</li></ul>
<p>If your player model has helper bones (i.e. for the wrists) present and properly weightmapped, don't forget to add a $proceduralbones line that points to the proper VRD file.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Non-standard_player_models"> Non-standard player models </span></h2>
<p>It's possible to have a player model that doesn't use the standard ValveBiped.Bip01 set of bones at all, but it will need to have its own animations with the correct activities assigned to what you need. (for a sandbox playermodel, you'd want all activities present, but for a "restricted" gamemode, like Ultimate Chimera, only a small subset need to be present)
</p><p>You can see a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="/page/Player_Animations">list of activities over at this article</a>.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="LOD_settings"> LOD settings </span></h2>
<p>Very very very important! Don't miss out on these! <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="/page/Player_model_LOD_settings">Read the article about them</a>.
