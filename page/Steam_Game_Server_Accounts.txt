</p><p>Make sure your Steam account matches all the requirements, then enter the required information into the text boxes on the page.
</p>
<ul><li> The first field should always be set to 4000 for Garry's Mod.
</li><li> The second field can be anything that will help you identify the specific server in a list of other Steam Game Server Accounts.
</li></ul>
<p>Then press Create.
</p><p>After pressing Create, the page will reload and a new entry will be shown on the page, containing the memo, the login token and the app id for which the login token is generated for.
</p><p>From this page you also can:
</p>
<ul><li> Delete any Login Tokens you own
</li><li> Generate a new Login Token for given server ( You will need to change it on your server too )
</li><li> Set another memo for any Login Token you own
</li></ul>
<p><b>WARNING! EACH SERVER MUST HAVE UNIQUE LOGIN TOKEN!</b>
</p><p>Once you got your Login Token, copy it and add the following to your command line parameters:
<code>+sv_setsteamaccount YOURLOGINTOKENHERE</code>
and restart your server.
</p><p>Your server will now have a static SteamID/Steam Account.
