<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Our_rules_3">Our rules</span></h2>
<p>Violating these will get your submission incompatible. It will be viewable by you and your friends.
</p>
<ul><li> <b>Do not upload addons with malicious elements</b> - All addons containing any sort of exploits or backdoors will be removed. This includes giving yourself elevated access over other users (SteamID checks, Giving yourself Admin status, RunString, spawning entities, etc), forcing people to be connected to different servers against their will, crashing or otherwise preventing the player from using the addon in private or on their servers.
</li><li> <b>Do not release stolen code</b> - All addons that are proven to have stolen code will also be taken down.
</li><li> <b>Do not upload retail game content</b> - All addons containing any content from a paid game (e.g. CS:S, Portal or Half-Life 2 games) will be removed. This includes props that are required for your addons to work. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2393-RUIG-0223">Your account can be terminated for this!</a> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4000/discussions/1/624075036453294488/#c624075036463641026">[1]</a>
</li><li> <b>Avoid requiring other addons</b> - In some cases this is permissible - like if it's an addon for a gamemode. <b>If your addon does require another addon - it shouldn't error if that addon isn't present. It should just do nothing.</b>
</li><li> <b>Avoid uploading packs</b> - Unless they're all your work. A pack of your maps is fine. A pack of maps you found that you think are cool is not fine. A pack of your weapons are fine. A pack of cool weapons you downloaded is not fine. You should use Workshop collections instead.
</li><li> <b>Make an effort with the thumb</b> - Addons with blank or irrelevant thumbnails will be taken down. If you can't be bothered to make an icon for it then don't bother uploading it. You can learn how to update your icons <a href="/page/Workshop_Addon_Updating" title="Workshop Addon Updating">here</a>.
</li><li> <b>Do not upload broken addons</b> - Erroring addons will be removed. This includes Lua errors, missing custom models, sounds or materials. You should test your addons in <a href="/page/Dev_Branch" title="Dev Branch">Dev Branch</a> to make sure it is not broken in the next version of the game.
</li><li> <b>Do not upload multi-part addons</b> - What this means is that if your addon won't fit in a single addon - do not upload it.
</li><li> <b>Do not reupload addons</b> - Reuploaded addons will be taken down. Search workshop before uploading. <b>Reuploading workshop addons is strictly forbidden, whatever the reupload reason is. (Even if the original workshop addon was removed)</b>
</li><li> <b>Do not reupload newer versions of your addons</b> - Update the old one, don't upload a new one. Duplicates will be removed.
</li><li> <b>Do not abuse tags </b> - Mistagged addons will be taken down. This is mostly applicable to the gamemode tag, if you are uploading a content pack for your server, tag it as such. (ServerContent) Having all of the tags on the same addon is also forbidden.
</li><li> <b>Do not upload empty or placeholder addons</b> - Addons that require user to download something from description (an external link) are not allowed.
</li><li> <b>Do not upload 'test' addons</b> - Addons with no content or barely any content are pointless and are not allowed. Make effort with the content you upload.
</li><li> <b>Do not put intrusive/web advertisements into your addons</b> - Self-explanatory, Steam Workshop is a place for people to get their addons/mods, not adware. Any pop up ads are not allowed, including server ads. For server ads a <b>single</b> chat message is ok.
</li><li> <b>Everyone is allowed to use addons you upload</b> - Steam Workshop is not your personal file hosting, it is a distribution service for user generated content. By uploading your addons to Steam Workshop you agree that anyone can download and use your uploaded content. Things like "you are not allowed to use this addon on your server" or "this was made for only this server" are not permitted on Steam Workshop. Adding code (or entities on your maps, etc.) that would discourage or prevent players from being able to your addon on their servers or in singleplayer falls into the "Malicious Code" category.
