<p>This page describes a few hidden tricks map makers can use to affect interactions of Sandbox features with the map.
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Preventing_tools_from_being_used_on_certain_entities"> Preventing tools from being used on certain entities </span></h1>
<p>You can use the <b>gmod_allowtools</b> property on any entity in your map to allow only certain tools to affect the entity.
</p><p>The format for the value is a list of <b>tool class names</b> separated by a single space character. The <b>tool class name</b> is the file name of the tool inside the <b>garrysmod/gamemodes/sandbox/entities/weapons/gmod_tool/tools/</b> excluding the .lua file extension. It will also work with addons.
</p><p>For example setting it to the following value:
</p>
<pre><code data-language="lua">colour button balloon light lamp dynamite thruster paint</code></pre>
<p>Will only allow <b>Color, Button, Balloon, Light, Lamp, Dynamite, Thruster</b> and <b>Paint</b> Tools to be used on that entity.
This is what the "Color Room" in sandbox does.
</p><p>Leaving the field empty will disallow all tools from being used on the entity.
</p><p>This field also affects the "Hold C for Context Menu and right click on the entity" feature.
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Preventing_Physics_Gun_from_being_used_on_certain_entities"> Preventing Physics Gun from being used on certain entities </span></h1>
<p>Similarly you can use <b>gmod_allowphysgun</b> on any entity to prevent the Physics Gun from being able to pick that entity up.
</p><p>The only possible value here is 0 to disallow Physics Gun from interacting with the entity. Any other value will count as allowed.
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Adding_these_properties"> Adding these properties </span></h1>
<p>To add or edit any of these properties, you must disable the <b>Smart Edit</b> option in your <b>Object Properties</b> and manually add or edit the desired property.
</p><p>Here's an example - gm_construct's Color Room settings:
